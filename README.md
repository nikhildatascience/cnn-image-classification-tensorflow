# CNN Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images of clothing items into 10 categories.  
The model achieves **92.64% test accuracy** and demonstrates practical deep learning skills, including model optimization and regularization techniques.

## üöÄ Key Highlights
- Built and trained a CNN using **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Performed **data preprocessing** (normalization, one-hot encoding)  
- Visualized training progress and misclassified samples using **Matplotlib**  
- Applied **BatchNormalization, Dropout, and L2 regularization** to reduce overfitting  
- Compared optimizers (**SGD, RMSProp, Adam**) for better convergence  

## üìä Result
- Final model accuracy: **92.64%** on the test set  
- No overfitting observed with proper regularization  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Pandas  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)  
- Google Colab (training environment)
